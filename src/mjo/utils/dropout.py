    Defines Monte Carlo dropout Module as defined

    In summary, This technique uses the regular dropout
    which can be interpreted as a Bayesian approximation of
    a well-known probabilistic model: the Gaussian process.
    We can treat the many different networks
    (with different neurons dropped out) as Monte Carlo samples
    from the space of all available models. This provides mathematical
    grounds to reason about the model’s uncertainty and, as it turns out,
    often improves its performance.
